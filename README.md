# Hands on machine learning!

This is a first try to get along ml techniques using a more direct approach: hands-on.

After lots of theory and projects using open repos from github i finally decided to start trying on my own.

## Travel ladder

1. First thing is to build a deep nn (hidden layers>=1) from scratch (even if 'scratch' in 2020 means that with an import you have an entire library).
I'll be following this [Easy tensorflow instructions](https://www.easy-tensorflow.com/tf-tutorials/neural-networks/two-layer-neural-network).
2. Later i'll try something on my own and change the readme as soon as i find something interesting.

### Background
I'm 25, a __computer engineer__ that tries to do something new everyday. Graduated in feb 2019 and now fattending _master's degree_. Besides of that i work part-time 20 hrs/week as a _software developer_.
I've done some arduino/ESP8266/rpi projects (lastly using alexa integration) because i like all DIY stuff and being _hands-on_ wrt electronics.
I also go to each small meetings about coding, talks and so on.
